## 🔍 Introduction

Continual learning models must strike a delicate balance between **plasticity** (learning new tasks effectively) and **stability** (retaining previous knowledge). Although many recent methods utilize pre-trained backbones to improve stability, they largely rely on **a single backbone**, limiting adaptiveness and representation richness.

**LMSRR** introduces a **multi-source, dynamically optimized representation framework**, combining multiple heterogeneous pre-trained models with a novel set of optimization strategies, yielding robust and adaptive features for continual learning.

## 🧠 Framework Overview

</p>

LMSRR contains three major components:

### **1. Multi-Scale Interaction & Dynamic Fusion (MSIDF)**

- Interacts multi-source features across scales.
- Learns task-relevant feature selection via attention modules.

### **2. Multi-Level Representation Optimization (MLRO)**

- Dynamically refines backbone layers.
- Improves plasticity while preserving critical representations.

### **3. Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO)**

- Learns a switch vector controlling layerwise updating.
- Avoids over-regularization and improves new task learning.

Together, these form a unified optimization framework offering a strong trade-off between **stability** and **plasticity**.
